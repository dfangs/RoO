SECTION 2 RULES OF ORIGIN 

PART 1: Regional Value Content (RVC) 

(1) Examples of Calculation of RVC under the transaction value method (TV): 
- 
Example 1: A producer manufactures gear boxes classified in HS 8708.40. Such good is 
subject to the following rule of origin: 
8708.40-8708.91 A change to subheading 8708.40 through 8708.91 from any other 
heading; or 

A change to subheading 8708.40 through 8708.91 from subheading 

8708.99, whether or not there is also a change from any other heading, 

provided there is a regional value content of not less than 65 percent. 
In the production of the good, the producer incorporates non-originating materials classified in 
subheading 8708.99. Since the non-originating materials classified in subheading 8708.99 do not 
satisfy the change in tariff classification requirement of the first rule of origin, the producer has to 
apply the second rule of origin which establishes a regional value content requirement of 65 percent. 
The transaction value of the good, adjusted to a F.O.B. basis is $4000 USD. 

The value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good is $1300 
USD. 
The formula will be applied as follows: 


4 



Where: 
RVC: 
TV . VNM 
RVC = --------------- x 100 
TV 
the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; 
TV: transaction value of the good adjusted to a F.O.B. basis, except as 
provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 23; and 
VNM: value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the 
production of the good determined pursuant to Article 24. 
By applying the formula: 
4000 . 1300 
RVC = --------------- x 100 
4000 
Then: 
RVC = 67.5 percent 

Since the RVC is 67.5 percent, the good satisfies the RVC requirement and therefore qualifies as 
originating. 

-Example 2: A producer does not export the good directly but rather he sells his good to person 
A, who then exports the good. For the purposes of calculating the RVC, the TV of the good 
shall be adjusted where person A receives the good from the producer in the Area of a Party 
where the producer is located. 

- 
Example 3: A producer produces Good A which is subject to a regional value content 
requirement of 50 percent. In the production of Good A, the producer uses non-originating 
Materials A and B whose values are $30 and $68 USD respectively. In addition, the producer 
uses Material C whose value is $12 and the producer does not want to determine its origin. 
The transaction value of good A, adjusted to a F.O.B. basis is $222 USD. 


Provided that the origin of Material C is not determined, in applying the formula, its value would be
considered as part of the value of non-originating materials. 
The formula will be applied as follows: 


TV . VNM
RVC = --------------- x 100 
TV 


By applying the formula: 

222 . (30 + 68 + 12) 
RVC = --------------- x 100 
222 

Then: 
RVC = 50.5 percent 

5 



Since the RVC is 50.5 percent, the good satisfies the RVC requirement and therefore qualifies as 
originating. 

(2) The following figures apply to the Example on the application of paragraph 5 of Article 23 
(average of the RVC): 
GOOD A GOOD B GOOD C 
Transaction value = $150 USD Transaction value = $ 130 USD Transaction value = $ 147 USD 
Value of non-originating materials = 30 Value of non-originating materials = 70 Value of non-originating materials = 70 

Note: Goods A, B and C are classified in the same subheading under the Harmonized System 
and are subject to a regional value content of 50 percent. 

The producer decides to average the regional value content for Goods A, B and C, which he
produces in three different plants in a period of three months. 
The application of the RVC formula will be as follows: 


TV . VNM
RVC = --------------- x 100 
TV 


By applying the formula: 
(150 + 130 + 147) . (30 + 70 + 70) 
RVC = -------------------------------------------- x 100 
(150 + 130 + 147) 
Then: 

257 
RVC = --------------- x 100 
427 


RVC = 60.18 
% 


The RVC of Goods A, B and C is 60.18% therefore such goods qualify as originating. 

PART 2: Intermediate Materials 

(3) For the purposes of Article 26 (Intermediate Materials), the total cost will be calculated in 
accordance with Annex 1 of these Uniform Regulations. 
(4) Examples illustrating the provisions on intermediate materials: 
Example 1: A producer located in Mexico produces engines of a kind used for the propulsion of 
vehicles of Chapter 87 that are classified under HS 8408.20. 
According to Annex 4, the applicable specific rule of origin for the engine is the following: 
8408.20 No required change in tariff classification to subheading 8408.20, provided there 


is a regional value content of not less than 65 percent. 
The producer also produces a screw that is classified under HS 7318.15, which are used in the 
production of the engine that is classified under HS 8408.20. Both originating materials and non-
originating materials are used in the production of the screw. According to Annex 4, the applicable 
specific rule of origin for the screw is the following: 

6 



73.17-73.18 A change to heading 73.17 through 73.18 from any heading outside that group. 


All the non-originating materials used in the production of the screws are classified under HS 
Chapter 72. 
The costs to produce the screw are the following: 


Product costs: 
$1 
$7 
$1 
Value of originating materials 
Value of non-originating materials 
Other product costs 
Period costs (including $0.30 in royalties) $0.70 
Other costs $0.90 
Total cost of Material A $10.60 

The producer designates the screw as an intermediate material and determines that, because all of 
the non-originating materials that are used in the production of the screws undergo the applicable 
change in tariff classification, the screw would qualify as an originating material. 

The cost of the non-originating materials used in the production of the screw is therefore not 
included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of the engine for 
the purposes of determining the regional value content of the engine. 

Because the screw has been designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of the screw which 
is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional 
value content of the engine. The total cost of the engine is determined in accordance with the 
following figures: 

Product costs: 
$10.60 
$32 
$10 
$6.2 
Value of originating materials 
-intermediate materials 
-other materials 
Value of non-originating materials 
Other product costs 
Period costs $2.5 
Other costs $0.7 
Total cost of Good B $62 

Example 2: A producer located in Mexico produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value 

content requirement of 50 percent. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements. 
The producer self-produces Material A which is used in the production of Good B. Material A is 
subject to a regional value content of 50 percent. 

The transaction value of Good B is $22.80 USD. 
The costs to produce Material A are the following: 

7 


Product costs: 
Value of originating materials 
Value of non-originating materials 
Other product costs 
$3.00 
5.00 
0.50 
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs) 0.50 
Other costs: 0.10 
Total cost of Material A: $9.10 

When the producer designates Material A as an intermediate material, Material A is regarded as 
originating based on the following calculation: 

RVC (Material A) = ((Total cost . VNM) / Total cost) x 100 

Therefore: 

RVC (Material A) = (($9.10 . $5.00) / $9.10) x 100 = 45.05% 

Article 26 establishes that the RVC of the material shall be not less than the percentage set out in 
Annex 4, minus 5 percent; therefore the RVC of Material A shall be not less than 45%. Since the 
RVC of Material A is 45.05%, Material A satisfies the RVC requirement and qualifies as 
originating. 

Therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is not 
included in the value of non-originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value 
content of Good B. 

The formula to determine the RVC of Good B shall be applied as follows: 

TV . VNM 

RVC = --------------- x 100 
TV 
By applying the formula: 


22.80 . 10.00 
RVC = --------------- x 100 
22.80 
Note: The value of non-originating materials used in the production of Good B ($10.00) excludes 
the value of non-originating materials used in the production of Material A. 

Then, the RVC of Good B = 56.1% therefore, Good B qualifies as originating. 

PART 3: Fungible Goods and Materials 

Fungible Materials 

(5) The following examples are based on the figures set out in the table below and on the 
following assumptions: 
(a) 
originating Material A and non-originating Material A that are fungible materials are used in 
the production of Good A; 
8 



(b) one unit of Material A is used to produce one unit of Good A; 
(c) Material A is only used in the production of Good A; 
(d) all other materials used in the production of Good A are originating materials; and 
(e) the producer of Good A exports all shipments of Good A to Mexico from Japan.

(NOTE) ÅgOÅh denotes originating materials. ÅgNÅh denotes non-originating materials. ÅgOIÅh denotes 
opening inventory. 

-Example 1: FIFO method 
Good A is subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producer A needs to determine the 
regional value content of Good A. 

By applying the FIFO method: 

(i) the 100 units of originating Material A in opening inventory that were received in materials 
inventory on 12/18/04 are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good 
A shipped on 01/10/05; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of 
those goods is considered to be $0; 
(ii) the 100 units of non-originating Material A in opening inventory that were received in materials 
inventory on 12/27/04 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received 
in materials inventory on 01/01/05 are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 
units of Good A shipped on 01/15/05; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the 
production of those goods is considered to be $110 (100 units x $1.10); 
(iii) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in 
materials inventory on 01/01/05 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that 
were received in materials inventory on 01/05/05 are considered to have been used in the 
production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/05; therefore, the value of non-
originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $660 (600 units x 
$1.10); and 
(iv) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in 
materials inventory on 01/05/05 and 500 units of the 1,000 units or originating Material A that were 
received in materials inventory on 01/10/05 are considered to have been used in the production of 
9 



the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/05; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used 
in the production of those goods is considered to be $440 (400 units x $1.10)
. 


Example 2: LIFO method 
Good A is an electrical resistor that is classified under HS heading 85.33. 
According to Annex 4, the applicable specific rule of origin is the following: 
85.33-85.38 A change to heading 85.33 through 85.38 from any other heading. 
The non-originating Material A is a part for resistor used in the production of Good A and classifies 


under HS subheading 8533.90, therefore it does not undergo the applicable change in tariff 


classification. 
Therefore, where originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is an 
originating good and, where non-originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good 
A is a non-originating good. 


By applying the LIFO method: 


(i) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials 
inventory on 01/05/05 are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good 
A shipped on 01/10/05; 
(ii) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory 
on 01/10/05 are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped 
on 01/15/05; 
(iii) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials 
inventory on 01/16/05 are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of 
Good A shipped on 01/20/05; and 
(iv) 900 units, of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in 
materials inventory on 01/16/05 are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units 
of Good A shipped on 01/23/05. 
Example 3: Average method 
Good A is subject to a regional value content requirement. For the purpose of determining the 
regional value content of Good A, Producer A needs to calculate the average value of the Non-
Originating fungible material A (= (6) VNM of Material A) in the inventory. Such value is 
calculated on the basis of the ratio of the total value of non-originating Material A to total value of 
originating Material A and non-originating Material A in the following table. 

As of 01/05/05, there are 1100 units of originating material A and 1100 units of non-originating 
material A in the inventory. The regional value content of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 
01/10/05 is calculated as follows: 

$1,100 + $1,210 
Average unit cost of material A in the inventory = -------------------------- = $1.05 
1100 + 1100 


TNM $1,210 
RNM=--------------- x 100=------------------------ x 100 = 52.3809 Åc = approx. 52% 
TONM $1,100+$1,210 


10 



Therefore, the VNM of Material A in the formula for the calculation of regional value content of 
Good A is: 

$1.05(Average Unit Cost of Material A) x approx. 0.52 = 0.55

Example 1: FIFO method 
By applying the FIFO method: 


(i) the 100 units of originating Good A in opening inventory that were received in finished goods 
inventory on 12/18/04 are considered to be the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/05; 
(ii) the 100 units of non-originating Good A in opening inventory that were received in finished 
goods inventory on 12/27/04 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were 
received in finished goods inventory on 01/0l/05 are considered to be the 700 units of Good A 
shipped on 01/15/05; 
(iii) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished 
goods inventory on 01/01/05 and 600 units of 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were 
received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/05 are considered to be the 1,000 units of Good A 
shipped on 01/20/05, and; 
(iv) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in 
finished goods inventory on 01/05/05 and 500 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that 
were received in finished goods inventory on 01/10/05 are considered to be the 900 units of Good A 
shipped on 01/23/05. 
Example 2: LIFO method 
By applying the LIFO method: 


(i) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods 
inventory on 01/05/05 are considered to be the 100 nits of Good A shipped on 01/10/05; 
(ii) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods 
inventory on 01/10/05 are considered to be the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/05; 
(iii) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods 
inventory on 01/16/05 are considered to be the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/05; and 
12 



(iv) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished 
goods inventory on 01/16/05 are considered to be the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/05. 
Example 3: Average method 
Exporter A chooses to determine the origin of Good A on monthly basis. Exporter A exported 3,000 
units of Good A during the month of February 2004. The origin of the units of Good A exported 
during that month is determined on the basis of the preceding month, that is January 2004. 


By applying the average method: 


the ratio of originating goods to all goods in finished goods inventory for the month of January 
2004 is 40.4% (2,100 units/;5,200 units)
; 
based on that ratio, 1,212 units (3,000 units x .404) of Good A shipped in February 2004 are


considered to be originating goods and 1,788 units (3,000 units - l ,212 units) of Good A are


considered to be non-originating goods; and 
that ratio is applied to the units of Good A remaining in finished goods inventory on January 31, 
2004: 1,010 units (2,500 units x .404) are considered to be originating goods and 1,490 units (2,500 
units - l ,010 units) are considered to be non-originating goods. 


PART 4: Transshipment 

(7) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 35 (Transshipment), examples of documental 
proofs to be provided to the customs authority of the importing Party as evidence that the good has 
not lost its originating status are: 
- 
format or handwritten declaration issued by the customs authorities of the non-Party for 
goods being transshipped or temporarily stored; and 
- 
copies of bills of lading or airway bills for transportation from one Party to the other Party. 
PART 5: Definition of ÅgTotal CostÅh 

(8) For the purposes of subparagraph (r) of Article 38 (Definitions), the amount of direct and 
indirect overhead of the good that can be reasonably allocated to the good, shall not include: 
(i) 
costs and expenses of a service given by the producer of the good to another 
person, where the service is not related to the good; 
(ii) 
costs and losses resulting from a sale of a part of the producerÅfs company, 
which constitutes a discontinued operation; 
(iii) 
the costs and losses resulting from the sale of the producerÅfs capital assets; 
(iv) 
costs and expenses related to fortuitous cases or force majeure; and 
(v) 
profits obtained by the producer of the good, regardless of whether they were 
retained by the producer or paid to other persons as dividends and taxes paid 
on these profits, including taxes on capital gains.

(c) 
where the producer of the good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost 
allocation method to allocate to the good the direct material costs, the direct labor 
costs or the direct or indirect overhead or part thereof, which reasonably reflects the 
direct material costs, the direct labor costs or direct or indirect overhead incurred in 
the production of the good, that method shall be considered as a method to 
reasonably allocate costs and shall be used to allocate the costs to the good; 
(d) 
the producer of the good may determine a reasonable costs amount, when those costs 
have not been allocated to the good, as follows: 
18

choose one or more allocation bases that reflect a relationship between the 
overhead and the good, in accordance with subparagraphs (f) and (g); 
(e) 
the producer of the good may choose any reasonable costs allocation method, which 
shall be used throughout the producerÅfs fiscal year or period; 
(f)

for each good produced, in accordance with the following formula: 
AB 
CR=-------------- x 100 
TAB 


where 

CR: cost ratio with respect to the good; 

AB: allocation base for the good; and 

TAB: total allocation base for all the goods produced by the producer of the good;

the costs with respect to which an allocation base is chosen are allocated to a good in 
accordance with the following formula: 
CAG = CA x CR 
where 
CAG: costs allocated to the good; 
CA: costs to be allocated; and 
CR: cost ratio with respect to the good; 


(h) 
any costs allocated in accordance with any reasonable costs allocation method that is
