Note
For purposes of this chapter, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this definition:

(a)	dissolving in water or other solvents;

(b)	the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or

(c)	the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.

For purposes of heading 27.10, the following processes confer origin:
(a)	Atmospheric distallation:  A separation process in which petroleum oils are converted, in a distallation tower, into fractions according to boiling point and the vapor then condensed into different liquefied fractions.

(b)	Vacuum distillation:  Distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so low that it would be classed as molecular distillation.

Rules 1 through 7 of this Section confer origin to a good of any chapter or heading in this Section, except as otherwise specified in those rules.

Note 2
Notwithstanding Note 1, a good is originating if it meets the applicable change in tariff classification specified in the rules of origin in this Section.

Rule 1:  Chemical Reaction
A good, except a good of heading 38.23, that results from a chemical reaction in the territory of one or more of the Parties shall be treated as originating

Note:  For purposes of this Section, a "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process) that results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining whether a good is originating:

(a)	dissolution in water or in another solvent;

(b)	the elimination of solvents, including solvent water;  or

(c)	the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.

Rule 2:  Purification
For a good of chapters 28 through 35 or 38, a good that is subject to purification shall be treated as originating provided that one of the following occurs in the territory of one or more of the
Parties:

(a)	the purification results in the elimination of 80 percent of the impurities; or
(b)	the purification results in the reduction or elimination of impurities, rendering the good suitable:

(i)	as a pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substance;

(ii)	as a chemical good or reagent for analytical, diagnostic, or laboratory uses;

(iii)	as an element or component for use in micro-elements;

(iv)	for specialized optical uses;

(v)	for non toxic uses for health and safety;

(vi)	for biotechnical use;

(vii)	as a carrier used in a separation process; or

(viii)	for nuclear grade uses.

Rule 3:  Mixtures and Blends
A good of chapters 30 or 31, heading 33.02, subheading 3502.20, heading 35.06 through 35.07, or 37.07 shall be treated as originating if the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications, resulting in the production of a good having physical or chemical characteristics which are relevant to the purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials, occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties.

Rule 4:  Change in Particle Size
A good of chapter 30 or 31 shall be treated as originating if the following occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties:

(a)	the deliberate and controlled reduction in particle size of a good, other than by merely crushing (or pressing), resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution, or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials; or

(b)	the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a good, other than by merely pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution, or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials is considered to be origin conferring.

Rule 5:  Standards Materials
A good of chapters 28 through 32, 35 or 38, shall be treated as originating if the production of these materials occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties.

For purposes of this rule, “standards materials” (including standards solutions) are preparations suitable for analytical, calibrating, or referencing uses, having precise degrees of purity or proportions which are certified by the manufacturer.

Rule 6:  Isomer Separation
A good of chapters 28 through 32 or 35 shall be treated as originating if the isolation or separation of isomers from mixtures of isomers occurs in the territory of one or more of the
Parties.

Rule 7:  Separation Prohibition
A good that undergoes a change from one classification to another in the territory of one of more of the Parties as the result of the separation of one or more materials from a man-made mixture shall not be treated as originating unless the isolated material underwent a chemical reaction in the territory of one or more of the Parties

Note 2
Notwithstanding Note 1, a good is originating if it meets the applicable change in tariff classification or satisfies the applicable regional value content specified in the rules of origin in this Section.

Rule 1: Chemical Reaction
A good of chapter 39 or 40 that results from a chemical reaction in the territory of one or more of the Parties shall be treated as originating.

For purposes of this Section, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a biochemical process) that results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining whether a good is originating:

(a)	dissolution in water or another solvent;

(b)	the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or

(c)	the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.


Rule 2:  Purification
A good of chapter 39 shall be treated as originating provided that one of the following occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties:

(a)	the purification of a good results in the elimination of 80 percent of existing impurities; or

(b)	the purification results in the reduction or elimination of impurities, rendering the good suitable:

(i)	as a pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substance;

(ii)	as a chemical good or reagent for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory use;

(iii)	as an element or component for use in micro-elements;

(iv)	for specialized optical use;

(v)	for non toxic use for health and safety;

(vi)	for biotechnical use;

(vii)	as a carrier used in a separation process; or

(viii)	for nuclear grade use.

Rule 3:  Mixtures and Blends
A good of chapters 39 or 40 shall be treated as originating if the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the production of a good having physical or chemical characteristics which are relevant to the purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties.

Rule 4:  Change in Particle Size
A good of chapter 39 shall be treated as originating if the following occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties:

(a)	the deliberate and controlled reduction in particle size of a good, other than by merely crushing or pressing resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials is considered to be origin conferring; or

(b)	the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a good, other than by merely pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials is considered to be origin conferring.

Rule 5:  Isomer Separation
A good of chapter 39 is originating if the isolation or separation of isomers from mixtures of isomers occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties.

Chapter 39
