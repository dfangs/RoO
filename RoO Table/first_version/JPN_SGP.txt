Where
 
M.C.I.F.
F.O.B.
 

x 100
 

(a)	N.O.M. is the value content of non-originating materials of a good, expressed as a percentage;

(b)	M.C.I.F. is the C.I.F. value of non-originating materials used in the production of a good, which is determined in accordance with the Agreement on Customs Valuation, or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the material in the Party; and

(c)	F.O.B. is the value of a good as defined in sub- paragraph (b) of paragraph 4 of Article 23.

3.	Where “natural textile fibres” or “man-made staple fibres” are referred to in the Column “Rules” of Chapters
