(d)	“CPS” means “Change in Particle Size Origin Rule”:

For the purposes of chapter 39 (except for goods of headings 39.01 to 39.14), “change in particle size” means:

(i)	the deliberate and controlled reduction in particle size of a good, other than by merely crushing (or pressing), resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials; or

(ii)	the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a good, other than by merely pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which are relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and have different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials.

Any good of the above mentioned chapters that has undergone a change in particle size shall be considered to be an originating good if the process occurred in the Area of a Party;

(e)	“SM” means “Standards Materials Origin Rule”:

3824.60, and 38.25), “standards materials” (including standard solutions) are preparations suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses having precise degrees of purity or proportions which are certified by the manufacturer.

Any good of the above mentioned chapters that is a good produced as a standard material shall be considered to be an originating good if the production process occurred in the Area of a Party; and

(f)	“IS” means “Isomer Separation Origin Rule”:

For the purposes of chapters 28 to 32, chapter 35 and chapter 39 (except for goods of 2905.43, 2905.44, 2905.45, 2906.11, 2918.14, 2918.15,
