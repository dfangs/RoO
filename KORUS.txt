Rule 4:  Change in Particle Size 
A good of Chapters 30, 31, or 33, shall be treated as an originating good if the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of the good, including micronizing by dissolving a polymer and subsequent precipitation, other than by merely crushing or pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution, or defined surface area, which is relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and having different essential physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials, occurs in the territory of one or both of the Parties.

(c)	the addition or elimination of water of crystallization. 
Rule 2:  Mixtures and Blends Origin 
A good of Chapters 39 and 40 shall be treated as an originating good if the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications, resulting in the production of a good having different essential physical or chemical characteristics that are relevant to the purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials, occurs in the territory of one or both of the Parties. 
Rule 3:  Purification 
A good of Chapters 39 and 40 that is subject to purification shall be treated as an originating good provided that the purification occurs in the territory of one or both of the Parties and results in the following: 
(a)	the elimination of not less than 80 percent of the content of existing impurities; or  
(b)	the reduction or elimination of impurities resulting in a good suitable: 
(i)	as a pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substances;
