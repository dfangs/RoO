Chapter 27 Mineral Fuels, Mineral Oils and Products of Their Distillation; Bituminous Substances; Mineral Waxes
Note 1: For purposes of heading 27.07, a ‚Äúchemical reaction‚Äù is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

The following processes are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this definition:

(a) dissolving in water or other solvents;

(b) the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or

(c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.

Note 2: For the purposes of heading 27.10, the following processes confer origin:

(a) Atmospheric distillation - A separation process in which petroleum oils are converted, in a distillation tower, into fractions according to boiling point and the vapor then condensed into different liquefied fractions. Liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, diesel/heating oil, light gas oils, and lubricating oil are produced from petroleum distillation;

(b) Vacuum distillation - Distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so low that it would be classed as molecular distillation. Vacuum distillation is useful for distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as heavy distillates in petroleum oils to produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and residuum. In some refineries gas oils may be further processed into lubricating oils;

(c) Catalytic hydroprocessing - The cracking and/or treating of petroleum oils with hydrogen at high temperature and under pressure, in the presence of special catalysts. Catalytic hydroprocessing includes hydrocracking and hydrotreating;

(d) Reforming (catalytic reforming) - The rearrangment of molecules in a naphtha boiling range material to form higher octane aromatics (i.e., improved antiknock quality at the expense of gasoline yield). A main product is catalytic reformate, a blend component for gasoline. Hydrogen is another by-product;

(e) Alkylation - A process whereby a high-octane blending component for gasolines is derived from catalytic combination of an isoparaffin and an olefin;

(f) Cracking - A refining process involving decomposition and molecular recombination of organic compounds, especially hydrocarbons obtained by means of heat, to form molecules suitable for motor fuels, monomers, petrochemicals, etc.:

(i) Thermal cracking - Exposes the distillate to temperatures of approximately 540-650C (1000-1200F) for varying periods of time. Process produces modest yields of gasoline and higher yields of residual products for fuel oil blending,
(ii) Catalytic cracking - Hydrocarbon vapors are passed at approximately 400C (750F) over a metallic catalyst (e.g., silica-alumina or platinum); the complex recombinations (alkylation, polymerization, isomerization, etc.) occur within seconds to yield high-octane gasoline. Process yields less residual oils and light gases than thermal cracking;
(g) Coking - A thermal cracking process for the conversion of heavy low grade products, such as reduced crude, straight run pitch, cracked tars, and shale oil into solid coke (carbon) and lower boiling hydrocarbon products which are suitable as feed for other refinery units for conversion into lighter products; and

(h) Isomerization - The refinery process of converting petroleum compounds into their isomers.

Note 3: For the purposes of heading 27.10, ‚Äúdirect blending‚Äù is defined as a refinery process whereby various petroleum streams from processing units and petroleum components from holding/storage tanks combine to create a finished product, with pre-determined parameters, classified under heading 27.10, provided that the non-originating material constitutes no more than 25 percent by volume of the good.
